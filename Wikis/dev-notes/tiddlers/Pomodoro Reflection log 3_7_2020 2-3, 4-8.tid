title: Pomodoro Reflection log 3/7/2020 2-3, 4-8
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Just spent a double period (25+5+25), notating the [[Tag System]] locally on [[fs.type]], [[tmi.type]], and [[mi.type]]

Pomodoro is an intentional type of the group [[Flow Stops]], though I'm not sure ''intentional'' is a good ''fs.type''... 

Perhaps the Flow Stops type is more accurately [[fs.tunnel_vision]] and [[Pomodoro Reflection log]] is the remedial [[counter-habit]].

I'm taking a double break since it's a double period.

The whole end goal here is to explore and improve how [[mindfulness]] can [[improve Time Management]], in part by making reflection integrated in one's work [[routine]]. 

Earlier I identified a couple new tags for thought in previous logs: [[useful-distractions]] and [[remember-to-x]]. Also [[know-yourself]]. These are [[Counter Habits]] to maladaptive or overly expressed natural human tendencies for: novelty-seeking aka inattention, ??? aka forgetfulness/disorganization.

For [[know-yourself]], ego preservation may be part of why we fail to acknowledge our behavioral shortcomings. In some cases conservation of will until a more appealing moment could be beneficial, though putting exercise day after day is an obvious long-term risk. The excessive end of the self-awareness or self-accountability axis might be harmful in some ways, even with a constant supply of food, water, etc. We might have incomplete information, or moving too quickly in search of a mate leads often to rash choices, unpredictable outcomes (codependence, stress, social dynamic blowback). 

Another reason we might ignore the unbalanced part of our behavior or personality (besides ego-preservation, energy/will conservation) is if we accept we're not, for example, in shape enough, and though we have the energy and the rational understanding, we value our time higher for other things, which we are already confident in our capabilities and which give us proportionally better rewards: forming strong social bonds and growing our support system that way, succeeding in a lucrative career which guarantees some level of security and advantage, hyper-romantic tendencies for healthy mutualistic gain or parasitic/commensalistic attachment even. 

[[Know Yourself]] applies to the situation I'm in currently-- one where in spite of the overall theme to be more [[goal-focused]] and mindful, I've spent a whole work block writing the last paragraph and quit the item on my action list halfway through. Why? Sometime's I love the flow of writing, just for its own sake. I might rationalize my dysregulation as exploring ideas which take longer than 25 minutes to incubate. I'm knowingly choosing to a second time here, but that doesn't excusue the [[self-deception]] of the prior time block, which I planned in advance. Honestly reflecting now, I was bored with the notational system's boilerplate once the [[novelty-seeking]] reward of figuring out its design wore off. Some people are very conscientous, maybe obsessive compulsive, about following through and being thorough. It's likely an [[environmental advantage]] where opportunity is scarce and [[risk-tolerance]] low. 

That [[hard-working conscientiousness]] has truly never been my nature. That is why I'm so [[consciously hyper-organizational]]-- to compensate for weak follow-through. I must set systems in place to [[reduce the friction]] of my [[natural disinclinations]]. 

* [[Which environmental contexts do people with my personality thrive?]]. 
* [[What coping mechanisms are holding me back, and how can I compensate successfully?]] 
* [[How can I avoid the repeated trauma of dangerously low risk-aversion? And which specific examples am I referring to and accountable for?]] 
* [[Where else am I unbalanced and not even aware? Where am I underestimating or not seeing?]] 
* [[What exactly do I have to give up to become more conscientious? Have I been earnest in my claims of progress?]] 
* ''TODO!'' [[How long until I follow-though answering these questions?]] [[TODO_NEXT]]
* [[How much of my personal growth is real, and how much is delusion?]] 
* [[Are my hyper-organizational strategies helping me meet my goals at an acceptable rate?]]
* ''TODO!'' [[When will I articulate my goals? Why haven't I yet? I've intended to for years, and always get off track. How? Why?]] [[TODO_NEXT]]
* [[How can I accurately quantify the friction of my natural disinclinations? I measured the loss financially in therapy for a particular behavioral pattern. Where else can I do this, but in an ongoing way, so I stay on track?]]
