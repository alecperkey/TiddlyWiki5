title: My boyfriend and i had a complete honest conversation last night and it felt wonderful.
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

We've only known each other for 3 months but decided we're committed to getting to know more about eachother. Recently, I've been having severe issues with anxiety. ''We were sitting on my couch and he was telling me how taxing it is to be with someone who has anxiety who isn't making an effort to change. He told me that he doesn't think I'm in a position to be in a serious relationship right now and that hit me hard. He wasn't being mean in any way of saying these things, by the way.''

I ended up going to the dining room to cry. I went out to the kitchen to get some paper towels and he came in, looked sadly at me, then came up behind me and hugged me. He turned me around, looked at me sadly and concerned, and pulled me in again. I started crying on his shoulder while he kissed my head. ''I laughed and said I didn't want to get snot on his shirt and he smiled.'' At that point I was getting sad again and left to the bathroom to cry some more. After a few minutes, I came out and we had a full on conversation about how I need to change.'' I expressed to him that realizing that I was so close to losing him due to me letting anxiety control me hit me.'' And truth be told, I do want to change. I see huge potential with this guy. He told me that he sees potential in me. I said, "I'm worried you want to already be done with me". And he replied with, "If that were the case, I would've told you, stopped texting you, and took my things I let you borrow". So that made me feel a lot better.'' He basically told me that he knows I can get through my issues, and it's just that the situation is difficult, and it's not my fault. He told me that he wants to see how things go. He believes in me. That made me extremely emotional and happy.''

After that, we spooned on the couch and talked even more deeply about things. ''We both expressed to each other that we don't truly love each other, like people in a 5 year relationship would. ''We haven't really said I love you yet at all. He said he's not head over heels for me and isn't afraid to lose me, but he thinks it's because he's afraid to let his guard down and whatnot. I'm just so happy we were completely honest and we both understood. ''We're taking things slow, the way they should be.'' We aren't letting excitement and infatuation boil over. With my past relationships, I fell for them quickly and started buying them things within a month of knowing them. I made my ex a photo album of us and future dates, which is kinda cringy haha. But with this new guy, I feel the need to really slow down. He's intelligent, and a great communicator. He understands most things about me. I appreciate him so much. I appreciate him giving me the hard truth, because that is inspiring me to change. I want to be happy for me and him. I want to grow with him.

So if you're reading this G, thank you.'' I've already took baby steps today in doing small things to make me happy, such as realizing the things I think aren't always true, and actually practicing guitar for more than 30 minutes. You inspire me to be a happier person.''
