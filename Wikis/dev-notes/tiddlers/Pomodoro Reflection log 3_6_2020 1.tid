doing a 1:1 mapping of concepts in the form of a cheat sheet: [[Vue vs React Cheat Sheet]]

should not document every detail: for example documenting every directive would not add to grapsing the concept of directives 

walking down the official api docs as a start is good

however I have downloaded cheat sheets for Vue so I will keep those in the other window, and scan them first. that way I can screengrab pieces and include them in my notes
