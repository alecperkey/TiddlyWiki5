title: Realm Interview
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* React Native Remote role
* Small startup / Realm.gg gaming social network
* Video talk, see if we're a good fit
* They need RN Frontend/Fullstack work, have some junior code of low quality. App did not scale past 30k users, had to pull beta off the app store
* They sent an MNDA after I agreed to try a example ticket as a sort of skills assessment
* Unsure if this is paid up front, don't think so
* After sent MNDA, provided a Figma invite link, but it hasn't shown yet
* Apparently I'm going to build a screen called `Search` as proof of capacity to work, sounds easy enough
* Going to prioritize prep for the [[IMC Interview 1]] tomorrow at 11 before looking at this.
** Will email tomorrow morning to let them know I didn't receive any Figma link.
