title: disengagement from job seeking
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* started after being turned down for single opportunity
* I made mistakes, was not fluid with my communication of React/programming concepts
* I never followed through with my idea to cataloug my knowledge in various areas of the profession
** I never made an outline of what that might look like ([[skills cataloug]])
* I didn't follow a routine and shrugged off the work, procrastinating
