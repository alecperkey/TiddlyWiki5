type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The more tacit knowledge of specific skills you have, the better. Since an interview is limited in time however, only a few minutes of speaking is spent on any 1 [[Development Topic|Development Topics]], usually. So, while deep knowledge in your [[Niche Areas of Expertise]] is a worthwhile pursuit, for interviewing it is necessary to demonstrate two or three things of insight.

Luckily, it doesn't take too much time and effort to attain a [[Wide Expertise]] to present yourself as the expert you likely are, if only in your niche. Not doing this is the antithesis of //Jack of All Trades//, where if you can't get by broadly, nobody will give you a chance to be the //Master of One//.

Sometimes, you don't even realize you're wide expertise until you consider it.
