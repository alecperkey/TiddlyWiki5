title: why did you leave Nexient

''why did you leave Nexient?'' : 

I really liked the team, the management style, and the work. I had made plans a few months earlier to leave Michigan and let them know.

Specifically I left to travel & reconnect with friends out west, before deciding to join my family in sunny Florida.
