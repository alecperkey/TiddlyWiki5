title: why did you leave IDR
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''why did you leave IDR?'': 

The code architecture and talent on the Hilton project was excellent. There was a combination of reasons I wanted to move on: ''1)'' Hours became excessive and unpredictable. Calls at 7am through midnight are fine occassionally, but not all the time. ''2)'' Their approach to remote meetings over a spotty VOIP system and with many thick accents impacted the work often. ''3)'' I was willing to compromise since the pay was excellent, but became frustrated with the project management and scrum leader's misprioritization and micromanagement of decisions normally delegated to the lead devs. ''4)'' //I became more excited to work for a company called Duo in Ann Arbor. They later moved away from React Native, and I eventually joined Nexient.//
