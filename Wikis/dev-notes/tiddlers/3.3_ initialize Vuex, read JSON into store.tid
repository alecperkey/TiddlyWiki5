title: 3.3: initialize Vuex, read JSON into store
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Let's use Vuex's example boilerplate, as its written by Evan You himself.''

* https://github.com/vuejs/vuex#examples

* we can just read the test.json into Vuex and maybe even cache it to localStorage

* Then we'll ''write some actions'' to call an async fn to gather needed images upon each Product Detail page the user visits

something like 

```javascript
// mock-data.json
async getResizedThumbnail(root.products[$id].photoname, thumbnailOptions)

// resize api: http://imageresizing.net/docs/basics
async getResizedThumbnail(root.products[$id].photoname, thumbnailOptions)
 
// Company Logo API http://images.repzio.com/productimages/${ManufacturerID}/logo${ManufacturerID}_lg.jpg

async getLogoImage(manufacturerID)
```
