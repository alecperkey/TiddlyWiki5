Hi Alec,

I love the sound of your experience and would really like to chat to you about a ''remote opportunity'', for someone with ''strong React Native experience''.

The role is with a high profile mobile payment provider and is a contract position for an ongoing period, starting at 6 months.

A quick background about us; we are a network of tech consultants, which started in the UK and is growing in the US. We are known for our quality of service and use of ''agile / XP'', with only experienced technologists and a ''progressive internal culture (think, flat hierarchy, autonomy and trust).''

It would be great to chat, when are you free?
