Based on my first conversation with Jordan, the hiring manager, he said the issue he often comes across is that people in JavaScript often get in older libraries of programming languages and fall away from more modern technologies in this space. He would love to see people with ''passion and experience in JavaScript working within react / redux specifically. I remember him mentioning a technology called Meiosis? ''https://www.codamit.dev/building-a-store-using-react-and-meiosis  

See the link above, it speaks more about react and meiosis. . Not a must have but if you heard of it might be a plus!

Culturally, Rhino is a smaller company with a ''start up mentality'' even though they have been around a little while now. About'' 10-12 employees, half are technical, half are back off (more business related)''.  They are looking to ''hire 3-4 technical people this year'' (they just hired an iOS mobile developer two weeks ago from us!). They love 

# ownership in work, 
# transparency,
# good communication, 
# and passion for technology in people. 

As they are all'' primarily remote'', so ''communication and trust when it comes to communication is key''! Speak about having 

# ''heavy ownership in the work you do would be KEY! 
''
For the technical work... Everything we do is 

# single page apps,  and is primarily a 
# green field right now. MEaning alot of the building will be done by this person and us working as a team.
# They build things in'' storybook components'', don’t use story books though (I am not sure what he meant by this exactly, maybe it makes sense to you?).
# You ''will work closely with Jordan and David'', they are two ''technical developers'' in this area.. 

!! ''2 main projects right now:  ''

# ''Consumer facing app ''
## (Instagram UI’s/ external) 
# and the ''other app which will be a rhino facing application ''
## (internal). 

Hope this helps some! best of luck, look forward to hearing how it goes.. He will be calling you directly.
