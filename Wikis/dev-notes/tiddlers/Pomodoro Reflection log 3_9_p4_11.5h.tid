Project: Interview Prep ToC

The table of contents internal macro is awesome. I should be using it in a lot of places I've used list-links or tree macros

Setting up a dev topics ToC as example, but it is more important to spend P5::6 on interview action, I will file dev topics ex for later, perhaps using it with Work History and Vue Index instead

Having bad posture atm 

added `''prioritize [[Areas to use ToC Macro]]''`
