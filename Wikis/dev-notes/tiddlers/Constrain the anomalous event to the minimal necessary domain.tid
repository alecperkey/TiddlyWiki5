Bad:

# "You've always been like that, and you always will!"

* Don't open the doorway to every possible snake, that is a pathway to [[Depression]].
* Don't let every small event open a cascade through your entire value system, i.e.:
** "I didn't get hired, since my skills aren't sharp, since I don't spend enough time programming, since I am not a real programmer, since I just coast by on my intelligence without practice, because I've always been lazy and mediocre, in all areas of my life."
