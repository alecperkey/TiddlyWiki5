Hi Alec,

Thanks for the chat yesterday. 

I've tentatively booked this time but I need to wait for Paul Stringer to confirm his availability.  Once confirmed, I'll update the invite.  I hope it still works for you.

The purpose of the interview is to ''assess your React Native experience'', your ''general approach to software design'' and ''use of XP practices''.  In prepareation please read through our ''technical values'': https://www.equalexperts.com/our-people/our-values/?=1.

For the actual interview, please use the Hangout link above.  The interview will be remote.  Please come ''prepared with your computer setup and ready to start coding using React Native''.

Paul will brief you on the solution we want you to build and will pair with you throughout the session. 

Paul - Alec's resume is attached.

If you have any questions, please do get in touch.  Otherwise I'll follow-up after the interview.


Thanks Alec.

Katie
