title: Meaningful engagement in behavior
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Behaviors have scalable effects both temporally and socially.

Temporally: what I do today effects tomorrow, my week, month, year, entire life, legacy.
Socially: what I do effects me, my family, my community, the entire world.

Feeling meaningfully engaged depends factors in these frames (often unconsciously).
