<<list-links "[tag[Article_property]sort[title]]">>


a property of the Article class useful for the tag system. It doesn't represent any connection to another Node at this time. Perhaps it should be an edge if it represented <E:isReadBy:${N.Person}, or a field of Article if the Tag System UI didn't benefit from its representation this way currently.
