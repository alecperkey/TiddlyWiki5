This article is NOT about fast problem solving. Fast problem solving is based on expertise and speed. It can often be reduced to quick choices among available options. This article is about tough problems that are based on vast and complex knowledge that may be full of falsehoods and contradictions. Slow problem solving may span decades. It can be used, for example, to find major answers in science.
