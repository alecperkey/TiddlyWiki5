title: most devDependencies can be pulled up to the root of the monorepo
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

https://github.com/lerna/lerna#concepts

This has a few benefits:

#All packages use the same version of a given dependency
#Can keep dependencies at the root up-to-date with an automated tool such as GreenKeeper
#Dependency installation time is reduced
#Less storage is needed

Note that devDependencies providing "binary" executables that are used by npm scripts still need to be installed directly in each package where they're used.
