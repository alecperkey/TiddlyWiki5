What makes a node an Article, includes: 

* containing fields:
** [[source]]
** [[publisher]]
** [[released]]

Additionally, the content of the 'Article' entity nodes may contain:

* plain text notes specific to the Article instance
** ideally these are minimal
* unstructured or semi-structured graph data
** via links within the card's content
* highly structured graph data
** such as use of [[Topic]] tags, which represent a consistent edge type between the Article instance and a Topic node
*** this //consistent edge type// representation is known as an [[Edge_shorthand]], in this instance the [[Article>includes>Topic]]
