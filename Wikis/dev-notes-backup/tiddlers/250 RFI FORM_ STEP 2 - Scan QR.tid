title: 250 RFI FORM: STEP 2 - Scan QR
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

As a foreman, I see:
Black header navigation: Save & Exit - UI only, functionality called in Story 261
Breadcrumbs to go to Step 2 (described in ticket 114)
Header: Scan QR
Phase A, B & C sections:
Serial Number
8-Digit Radio ID
Field Current
Scan button - depending on which phase they click on, goes to the Scan A, B or C screen.
As users captures the scan, they come back to this page with the info captured filled out in the fields.
the button copy changes from Scan to "Rescan" if there is a previous scan already
Installation Direction, drop down
North (N)
East (E)
South (S)
West (W)
Northeast (NE)
Southeast (SE)
Southwest (SW)
Northwest (NW)
Lat/Long info should be blank till it is captured.
Lat long will be displayed for Phase A, unless there is no phase A scan, in that case it will be for Phase B & If there is no Phase B, then it will be for Phase C.
Continue to Review and Confirm button
Button is greyed out, till the required fields are entered - Required fields are at least one set of 3 completed fields for Phase A, B OR C
For validation: If user goes clicks the button with less than 3 set (A, B, or C) completed, display pop-up with confirmation message:
Looks like you skipped Phase <insert missed phase or phases>. Did you want to install <insert missed phase or phases>?
Close - closes the pop-up & user stays on the screen
Skip - skips the unscanned phases & goes to "C" below
Save work so far & Goes to Step 4
Match UX
Error Messaging - If user enters amp less than 15 in any of the field current fields, then display the following message in the pop-up (style similar to other pop-ups for messaging as per the style guide:
If the minimum line current is less than 15 amps, do-not install the RFI at the site and contact the District (Troubleman) and Field Engineering to identify an alternate location.
